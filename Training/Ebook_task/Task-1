1)Update c topics properly
  "https://github.com/Saamy1998/c-program/blob/8f6b181a21b445c4e8f4ed680d3c12901fead7ff/Training/c%20topics"

2)Other name for "Symbolic Constent"
 Symbolic constant also known as constant identifiers
  

3)nl = nw = nc = 0; vs nl = (nw = (nc = 0));
 Where nl=nw=nc=0 assign values from left to right  and nl=(nw=(nc=0)) assign value from right to left
 
4)nl=(nw=(nc=if(a=0));
 If a=0 then it returns value 1 and nc is assigned as 1 otherwise it returns 0 and nc is assigned as o, then nw is assigned as 0 and finally nl assigned as 0 

5)Value of EOF
 The value of EOF is"-1"

6)Program on Array
 "https://github.com/Saamy1998/c-program/blob/2831e7e920c286e1042426572e31da87d8744deb/Training/Ebook_task/array.c"

7)Difference b/w call by value and call by reference
 Call By Value: Value of an argument into the formal parameter of that function. Therefore, changes made to the parameter of the main
 function do not affect the argument.

 Call by Reference: Both the actual and formal parameters refer to the same locations, so any changes made inside the function are 
 actually reflected in actual parameters of the caller

8)Program on Character Array
 "https://github.com/Saamy1998/c-program/blob/42baaf4341fb4bab9f2dd90ec73e21d187b4f011/Training/Ebook_task/char.c"

9)Character Array program with Max 40 charcter

10)Character Array program with 40 character in reverse
